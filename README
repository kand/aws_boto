Starting up an EC2 instance
---------------------------
From the src/ folder, run python and run:
    >>> from ec2.util *
    
Initialize the class:
    >>> a = util(<aws access key>,<aws secret key>)
    
Open a connection to EC2 and start up an instance:
    >>> a.open()
    >>> a.startInstance("instance1", "basicLinuxx32", "t1.micro", <aws key pair name>)
    
Once this function completes, you should have a running instance visible through the AWS management console.

To stop the instance, call:
    >>> a.stopInstance("instance1")
