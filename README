Starting up an EC2 instance
---------------------------
From the src/ folder, run python and run:
	>>> from ec2.util *
    >>> a = util(<aws access key>,<aws secret key>)		#to initialize the class
    >>> a.open()										#to open the EC2 connection
    >>> a.startInstance("instance1", "basicLinuxx32", "t1.micro", <aws key pair name>)	#starts an instance named in VALID_IMGS
    
Once this function completes, you should have a running instance visible through the AWS management console.

To stop the instance, call:
    >>> a.stopInstance("instance1")
